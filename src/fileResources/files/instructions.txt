Before you start the game you must enter a name and select your character. 
Once you have done that click the 'join' button.

LEVEL LAYOUTS:
On the right is the arena where the monster will move around in.
On your left you will see a panel that displays a list of statistics, your characters picture, a pause button (to pause the game), and a resume button (to resume game after pausing). 
The statistics include:
- the current level you are one
- the name you entered
- the strength of your characters attack (how much damage you do to the monster)
- how much time you have left to kill the monster
- how much health the monster has
- your current score

HOW TO PLAY:
Your goal is to kill the monster within 20 seconds. You attack the monster by clicking on it. Each time you click the monster it's health will be decrease.

If the time runs out before the monster dies, the game is over. If the monster dies before time runs out, you will proceed to the next level.

After you defeat each monster your characters attack strength will increase, your score will increase (see the 'Score' section for more details) and a new monster will appear for you to kill. Each new monster will have more health than the last but you will have the same amount of time for each level.

The next level will have a different monster but it will have more health than the last. You will have the same amount of time as the last level to kill the monster.

SCORE:
After you complete each level you will receive 100 points + bonus points based on how much time is left when the monster dies.
